		<p>An opportunity to follow up with a local CDC executive during the COVID-19 pandemic gave me clarity on where I was headed. As an advocate, I fought on the front lines of working diligently to test community residents for nucleic acid while the exhaustion of work tasted like maltose in my mouth, the sweeter I chewed. </p>
		<p>It didn't take long for my concentration on various diseases- chronic diseases, infectious diseases, rare diseases, typical diseases, and mental illnesses- to be born. During the quarantine, I participated in a research platform provided by Harvard Medical School, which was a systematic study of public health and preventive medicine, and took the opportunity of HAWK to write an article on <span style="font-style: italic;">The Neglected Side of NCD: Increasing Trends among Adolescents</span> . Studying with undergraduate and graduate students, I collaborated on research regarding Appetite and Metabolism Therapies in the Treatment of Obesity with a Cambridge professor. </p>
		<p>Besides, my deep-seated interest in mental health led me to organize my team to design an experimental protocol for the treatment of depression by autonomic synthesis of 5-HTP and GABA strains in the iGEM. We created a probiotic that would regulate depression based on the gut-brain axis. Plus, I also led the team to develop a suicide system for the strain to adhere to the concept of sustainable development.</p>
		<p>Presently, under a researcher in charge of protein editing, I am interning at The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. At this internship, I have learned more advanced pharmaceutical technologies for rare diseases and cancer, such as Knob into Hole, Crossman, DuoBody, BiTE, TandAB, etc. </p>

		<p style="color: #108b96;">(2) Psychological Status and Intervention Measures of Adolescents during the COVID-19 Pandemic (to be published) </p>
		<p>Abstract: For adolescents, the suspension of offline learning, social isolation, family economic crisis, and family-generated illness or loss are affecting their mental state and daily behavior. According to CDC data, as of 2021, 37.1% of students developed poorer mental health problems during the COVID-19 Pandemic. This paper explores the hidden dangers of adolescent mental health under the epidemic and the changes and effects of the isolation and confinement of the epidemic on various aspects of adolescents, and analyzes ways to address and alleviate adolescent depression, first from the perspective of the adolescents themselves, and additionally at various levels, including family, school, community, and government. The authors use psychological experiments and literature analysis to provide strong evidence for this paper on the one hand to demonstrate the direct and potential impact of multiple factors on adolescent mental health during the epidemic and the effective ways of intervention by various psychological means. Finally, the paper also provides a telemedicine approach that offers a new way of thinking and a new approach to address mental illness in adolescents during the epidemic, complementing the treatment modalities that are lacking today.</p>
		<p style="color: #108b96;">(3) <span>The Neglected Side of NCD: Increasing Trends among Adolescents</span> </p>
		<p>Abstract: It is well-known that NCD are mainly dominated by cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The medical community usually thinks of NCD as a disease exclusive to the elderly, but studies have found that adolescents are increasingly suffering from NCD. The future of the world will be at stake in how to control the occurrence of adolescent NCD, as no one wants the most dynamic group of future society to be dragged down by a chronic disease, even though it does not appear to be as dangerous as COVID-19 and HIV. </p>
		<p>This article clarifies the different roles of the four participating actors: family, community, school, and telemedicine in the health management of adolescent Non-communicable Diseases (NCD) patients, and proposes reflections on their future directions in the health management of adolescent diabetes mellitus, to help adolescent chronic disease patients adjust to "normalcy" in their physical, psychological, academic, and social lives as soon as possible. The aim is to help adolescents with chronic disease adjust to a "normal state" in terms of physical, psychological, academic, and social life. </p>
